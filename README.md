# Crop Recommendation Dataset Analysis Report

#### Introduction
In modern agriculture, leveraging data-driven approaches for precise crop recommendations is essential to ensure optimal yield and sustainability. This report presents an analysis of a comprehensive dataset containing soil composition and environmental variables, including Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium levels, Temperature, Humidity, pH_Value, and Rainfall. Understanding these factors helps in making informed decisions to enhance agricultural productivity, resource management, and overall crop health.

#### Dataset Overview
The dataset comprises 2200 entries with the following columns:
- **Nitrogen**: Nitrogen level in the soil
- **Phosphorus**: Phosphorus level in the soil
- **Potassium**: Potassium level in the soil
- **Temperature**: Temperature in Celsius
- **Humidity**: Humidity percentage
- **pH_Value**: pH value of the soil
- **Rainfall**: Rainfall in mm
- **Crop**: Type of crop
